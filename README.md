# Android Interview Questions
Here you will find top interview questions. Some questions are very common and they are being asked frequently in every interview.
I will highlight some important topics into this thread. 

# Android Basics


* ***What is Context?***

Interface to global information about an application environment. This is an abstract class whose implementation is provided 
by the Android system. It allows access to application-specific resources and classes, as well as up-calls for application-level 
operations such as launching activities, broadcasting and receiving intents, etc.

Two types of context -> 
1) Application Context 
2) Activity Context.

[See this for more details](https://blog.mindorks.com/understanding-context-in-android-application-330913e32514)


* ***What is Intent? Explain in brief explicit and implicit intent.***

An intent is to perform an action. It is mostly used to start an activity, send broadcast receiver, start services.

1) Explicit Intent: In such a case, intent provides the external class to be invoked.
Explicit intents are used in the application itself wherein one activity can switch to other activity.
Example ```Intent intent = new Intent(this,Target.class);```

3) Implicit Intent: It doesn't specify the component. In such a case, intent provides information on available components provided 
4) by the system that is to be invoked.

Implicit Intents do not directly specify the Android components which should be called, 
it only specifies action to be performed. A Uri can be used with the implicit intent to specify the data type.

```Intent intent = new Intent(ACTION_VIEW,Uri.parse("http://www.google.com"));```

* ***What is content provider?***

Content providers can help an application manage access to data stored by itself, stored by other apps, and provide a way to share data with other apps. They encapsulate the data, and provide mechanisms for defining data security.

* ***The last callback in the lifecycle of an activity is onDestroy(). The system calls this method on your activity as the final signal that your activity instance is being completely removed from the system memory. Usually, the system will call onPause() and onStop() before calling onDestroy(). Describe a scenario, though, where onPause() and onStop() would not be invoked.***

onPause() and onStop() will not be invoked if finish() is called from within the onCreate() method. This might occur, for example, if you detect an error during onCreate() and call finish() as a result. In such a case, though, any cleanup you expected to be done in onPause() and onStop() will not be executed.
Although onDestroy() is the last callback in the lifecycle of an activity, it is worth mentioning that this callback may not always be called and should not be relied upon to destroy resources. It is better have the resources created in onStart() and onResume(), and have them destroyed in onStop() and onPause(), respectively.

* ***What is difference between Serializable and Parcelable ? Which is best approach in Android?***
 
Serializable is a standard Java interface. You simply mark a class Serializable by implementing the interface, and Java will automatically serialize it in certain situations.
Parcelable is an Android specific interface where you implement the serialization yourself. It was created to be far more efficient than Serializable, and to get around some problems with the default Java serialization scheme.

* ***What is the difference between Service and IntentService? How is each used?

Service is the base class for Android services that can be extended to create any service. A class that directly extends Serviceruns on the main thread so it will block the UI (if there is one) and should therefore either be used only for short tasks or should make use of other threads for longer tasks.
IntentService is a subclass of Service that handles asynchronous requests (expressed as “Intents”) on demand. Clients send requests through startService(Intent) calls. The service is started as needed, handles each Intent in turn using a worker thread, and stops itself when it runs out of work. Writing an IntentService can be quite simple; just extend the IntentServiceclass and override the onHandleIntent(Intent intent) method where you can manage all incoming requests.

* ***What is broadcast receiver?

A broadcast receiver (receiver) is an Android component which allows you to register for system or application events. All registered receivers for an event are notified by the Android runtime once this event happens.

We can use broadcast receiver to know -> check whether an internet connection is available, what the battery label should be, etc.


* ***Which method is called only once in a fragment life cycle?

onAttached()

* ***Is it possible to create an activity in Android without a user interface ?

Yes, an activity can be created without any user interface. These activities are treated as abstract activities.

* ***Activity Lifecycle

OnCreate → Creates the activity
OnStart → User can see the screen
OnResume → When user can interact the screen

onPause → when part of app is visible but in background
onStop → When app is not visible to user
OnDestroy → when activity is destroyed

* ***When should you use a Fragment rather than an Activity?
        
1) When you have some UI components to be used across various activities
2) When multiple view can be displayed side by side just like viewPager


* ***What is the difference between adding/replacing fragment in backstack?

The important difference is:
replace removes the existing fragment and adds a new fragment..
but add retains the existing fragments and adds a new fragment that means existing fragment will be active and they wont be in 'paused' state hence when a back button is pressed onCreateView() is not called for the existing fragment(the fragment which was there before new fragment was added).

* ***What is the purpose of addToBackStack() while commiting fragment transaction?

By calling addToBackStack(), the replace transaction is saved to the back stack so the user can reverse the transaction and bring back the previous fragment by pressing the Back button. 
   

# Design Pattern

* ***What is MVVM?***

Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) is a software design pattern that is structured to separate program logic and user interface controls.
The separation of the code in MVVM is divided into View, ViewModel and Model.

1) View is the collection of visible elements, which also receives user input. This includes user interfaces (UI), animations and text. The content of View is not interacted with directly to change what is presented.
2) ViewModel is located between the View and Model layers. This is where the controls for interacting with View are housed, while binding is used to connect the UI elements in View to the controls in ViewModel.
3) Model houses the logic for the program, which is retrieved by the ViewModel upon its own receipt of input from the user through View.

* ***Why you are using MVVM?***

we’re going with MVVM over MVP because Android Architecture Components already has a built-in ViewModel class—no MVVM framework necessary.

1) it separates the logic and view related code. It is more readable and understandable.
2) Improves testability. As view and logic are separate. It is easy to test view and logic
3) Logic and view parts are separate. So we know which part goes where.
4) Collaborative work. As view and logic parts are separate. Team can work each part separately. 

* ***What is the difference between MVVM and MVP?***

The one-to-one relationship exists between the Presenter and the View. Multiple View can be mapped with single ViewModel. The Presenter has knowledge about the View. ViewModel has no reference to the View.


* ***Do you have a problem working with MVVM?***

No I don’t. I have been working on Android development using MVVM pattern almost 5 years. So many support and sample project from google team. I actually love it. 

* ***What is SOLID?***

The SOLID Principles are five principles of Object-Oriented class design. They are a set of rules and best practices to follow while designing a class structure. 
they are:

1) The Single Responsibility Principle 
   A class should do one thing and therefore it should have only a single reason to change.
      
2) The Open-Closed Principle
   Classes should be open for extension and closed to modification.
   Modification means changing the code of an existing class, and extension means adding new functionality.
      
3) The Liskov Substitution Principle
   Subclasses should be substitutable for their base classes.
	 This means that, given that class B is a subclass of class A, we should be able to pass an object of class B to any 
   method that expects an object of class A and the method should not give any weird output in that case.
              
4) The Interface Segregation Principle
   Segregation means keeping things separated, and the Interface Segregation Principle is about separating the interfaces. 
	 The principle states that many client-specific interfaces are better than one 	general-purpose interface. 
   Clients should not be forced to implement a function they do no need.
      
5) The Dependency Inversion Principle
      Our classes should depend upon interfaces or abstract classes instead of concrete classes and functions.

* ***What does clean code mean to you?***

Clean code means that your code is easy to read, easy to understand, and easy to change. It's as simple as having descriptively named variables, functions, and classes so that as you read, you know what each contains or does without guesswork.

In a nutshell, to create understandable, readable, and testable code that many developers can collaboratively work on.


* ***What is Clean Architecture?***

Clean architecture is a software design philosophy that separates the elements of a design into ring levels. An important goal of clean architecture is to provide developers with a way to organize code in such a way that it encapsulates the business logic but keeps it separate from the delivery mechanism. 

It consists of UI Independence, Data independence, Framework independence, Testable.


# Threading

* ***What is multithreading***

Multithreading is a model of program execution that allows for multiple threads to be created within a process, executing independently but concurrently sharing process resources. Depending on the hardware, threads can run fully parallel if they are distributed to their own CPU core.

* ***What Is Multithreading Used For?***

The main reason for incorporating threads into an application is to improve its performance. Performance can be expressed in multiple ways:
1) A web server will utilize multiple threads to simultaneous process requests for data at the same time.
2) An image analysis algorithm will spawn multiple threads at a time and segment an image into quadrants to apply filtering to the image.
3) A ray-tracing application will launch multiple threads to compute the visual effects while the main GUI thread draws the final results.


# Reactive Programming (RxJava 2)

* ***What is Reactive Programming***

Reactive programming is programming with asynchronous data streams.

* ***Difference between concatMap and flatMap?***

Flatmap converts stream(s) into a single streams without maintaining a order where as concatmap does the same along with maintaining the order

Flatmap example -[[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]] -> [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]

Concatmap example -[[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]] -> [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

* ***When does Observable Start to Emit Items?***

In Observable, there are two types: Cold and Hot Observables. Cold Observables will perform work and subsequently emit items only once is someone has subscribed, whereas Hot Observables will perform work and emit items regardless of observers or not.

* ***How many times can onNext(), onError() and onComplete() be called?***

onNext() can be called from zero to an infinite number of times, onError() can be called at maximum once per stream; similarly onComplete() is called at maximum once per stream.

* ***Define Observable chain***

List of operations or transformations performed in between the source and end subscriber. One of the examples, it to emit User objects, filtering out the admin users and checking for authentication of users, and finally map full name.

* ***What is backpressure?***
Backpressure is the inability of a Subscriber to handle all incoming events in time. In other words Backpressure can occur when the Producer of events is faster than the Consumer. If not handled correctly it can error out a stream.

* ***How to deal with backpressure issues?***

If you thing Backpressure might occur, then Flowable with a correct BackpressureStrategy is the safest choice.


* ***Difference between FlatMap and Map***

1) Map
Map transforms the items emitted by an Observable by applying a function to each item.
2) FlatMap
FlatMap transforms the items emitted by an Observable into Observables.
In your case you need map, since there is only 1 input and 1 output. 
map - Supplied function simply accepts an item and returns an item which will be emitted further (only once) down.
flatMap - Supplied function accepts an item then returns an "Observable", meaning each item of the new "Observable" will be emitted separately further down. 
May be code will clear things up for you:

```
    Observable.just("item1").map(str -> {
        System.out.println("inside the map " + str);
        return str;
    }).subscribe(System.out::println);

    Observable.just("item2").flatMap(str -> {
        System.out.println("inside the flatMap " + str);
        return Observable.just(str + "+", str + "++", str + "+++");
    }).subscribe(System.out::println);

Output:
inside the map item1
item1
inside the flatMap item2
item2+
item2++
item2+++
```

* ***ZIP Operator***

Zip combine the emissions of multiple Observables together via a specified function and emit single items for each combination based on the results of this function.
Zip operator allows us to get the results from multiple observables at a time.

```
Observable.zip(
        getCricketFansObservable(),
        getFootballFansObservable(),
        BiFunction<List<User>, List<User>, List<User>> { cricketFans, footballFans ->
            return@BiFunction filterUserWhoLovesBoth(
                cricketFans,
                footballFans
            )
        }).subscribeOn(Schedulers.io()).observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread())
        .subscribe(getObserver())
```


# Data Structure

* ***Hash functions***

Hashing is the process of converting an input of any length into a fixed size string of text using a mathematical function. Any text can be converted into an array of numbers and letters through an algorithm. The message to be hashed is called input, the algorithm is to do so is called hash function and the output is called hash value.
